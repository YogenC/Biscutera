This is a simple Wi-Fi limiting automation. If something goes wrong, such as limiting the wrong app or being unable to allow an app, follow these steps to fix it:

Open your Windows Firewall settings.
Go to Advanced Settings.
In the Outbound Rules section, find the rule with a name like Block_pid_2213.
Select the rule and delete it.
That's it! Everything should be back to normal. ðŸ˜Š
